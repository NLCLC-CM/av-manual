# Setup

We use [mdBook](https://rust-lang.github.io/mdBook/) to generate our website.

For making bigger changes, you can do the following:

```console
$ mdbook serve
...
```

This will continuously watch all source files and rebuild accordingly. This will also serve a preview of
the book over HTTP on port 3000 by default. For more options, check the mdBook documentation page
above.
