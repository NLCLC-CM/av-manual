# Tips and tricks

**Make small changes to the levels (i.e. the mixer levels, the gain knob, etc.).** If you make large
changes, it increases the risk of sudden feedback, which causes panic, which may cause even bigger changes
to correct the mistake. Remember: make the small changes, then listen to the changes you made. This will
take some time for your ears to start picking up the changes (about a year or three).
