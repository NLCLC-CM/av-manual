# Cameras

There are pieces of sticky tape on both cameras, but the settings to change are the following:

- Settings -> CTRL for HDMI -> Off
- Settings -> Demo Mode -> Off
- Settings -> Power Save -> Off
- Photos -> Facial Recognition -> Off

These settings will already be mostly set on the camera that doesn't completely reset itself (the
right-most one usually).

Be cautious when touching the cameras in the winter because static electricity may reset the cameras.
Always discharge yourself on a nearby metal object.

# Zoom

- When users enter the room, be sure to greet them as an usher would

# Troubleshooting

I take a page out of commercial aviation: Aviate, Navigate, Communicate. Except we can skip the middle
one. The most important thing is to continue controlling the Powerpoint and on-site audio. There are
usually 2 people assigned to the Sunday post. 1 of them will do the Powerpoint and audio. The other will
be there to support and communicate, suggest ideas.

Remember: <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>tab</kbd> is your friend.

## No internet

You won't be able to do anything. Most likely, the following will happen after the internet disconnects
for more than 1-2 minutes: [YouTube livestream auto-ends](#youtube-livestream-ends-prematurely), Zoom
meeting auto-transfers host to a random other participant. You will be able to troubleshoot when internet
returns.

## Youtube livestream ends prematurely

You will only be able to troubleshoot when internet returns.

1. Go to YouTube and `Go live` again
2. Start streaming in OBS
3. Check that we are sending packets to YouTube by checking stream status on YouTube
4. Send the new stream link in Whatsapp
5. Redo the Zoom procedure
